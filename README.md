##Initial Plan:
* Gather Climate Data for West Lafayette
* Gather Location data for: Police Stations, Restaurants, and Medical Facilities.
* Plot coordinates from the location data on google maps and compare with all possible apartments/houses in West Lafayette.

##Issues and Problems:
* Figuring how climate might affect apartment/house selection.
* Developing an Algorithm to rate apartments/houses based on location data. [Maybe perform some algebra on the (distance-from-house)*(constant number)]
* Making the web application - Learn more JS.
* Gather more data to rate houses.
  * Neighbors.
  * Landlord.
  * Garbage Disposal.
  * Feature comparison(Might need to build a scraper of some sort).
  * Price.
  * Previous tenenants - Most difficult to obtain.
  * Crime Data
